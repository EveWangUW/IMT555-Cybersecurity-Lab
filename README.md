# Lab Summary - IMT 555 Foundations of Cybersecurity
üë©üèª‚Äçüíª In this lab, I coded in **Python** and **PHP** and utilized tools such as **Docker**, **Selenium**, and **Metasploit** to explore key cybersecurity concepts and practices through hands-on exercises. From setting up secure environments to performing penetration testing and identifying vulnerabilities, each lab provided practical experience with real-world tools and techniques.

üí° Specifically:
**Week 1: Getting Started** - Set up the environment and tools, including **Docker** and **PHP**, to prepare for hands-on security labs.
**Week 2: MiTM** - Conducted Man-in-the-Middle attacks to intercept and analyze insecure network traffic.
**Week 3: Encryption** - Implemented secure encryption methods with **certificates** and analyzed vulnerabilities in weak algorithms.
**Week 4: Logging** - Configured secure logging mechanisms using **Loggly** and mitigated risks such as log injection.
**Week 5: Access Control** - Replaced cookie-based authentication with session-based controls to prevent session hijacking.
**Week 6: Offensive Security** - Executed penetration testing with **Metasploit** to exploit vulnerabilities in a PHP application.
**Week 7: Application Security** - Identified and mitigated common web vulnerabilities, including SQL injection and XSS.
**Week 8: Bug Bounty** - Conducted vulnerability assessments, reported bugs, and remediated issues with supporting evidence.
**Week 9: Testing** - Performed security testing with **Selenium IDE** and **Pytest** to validate fixes and ensure compliance with security standards.
